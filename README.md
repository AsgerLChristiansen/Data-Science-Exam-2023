# Data-Science-Exam-2023
Data Science Exam for Asger L. Christiansen at the Master's Degree at Cognitive Science, Aarhus University, 2023.

Upon setting the working directory to the root folder, the three markdowns in the root directory should be able to be run in order.

The markdowns are numbered. Run number 1 first, number 2 second, and number 3 third.

At all times, before sampling in stan begins, seed is set to 1337. If everything goes well, this should ensure that all figures and results produced at the end are exactly identical to those I got on my own.

The code has extensive comments, but not to the extent of a line for line explanation of how it works. I've tried
to use intuitive function and variable names, and provide additional comments when necessary, to make it intuitive what's going on.

That said, the dataset is quite messy (try having a look at the incident_characteristics column of the raw data yourself!),
and as a result, the data wrangling is also a little messy.
